    "\n",
    "Loops are fundamental constructs in Python that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `for` Loop\n",
    "The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `while` Loop\n",
    "The `while` loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Loop Control Statements\n",
    "- `break`: Exits the loop prematurely.\n",
    "- `continue`: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.\n",
    "- `pass`: Does nothing and acts as a placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are powerful tools that help you process data efficiently and write concise, readable code.\n"
