    "\n",
    "1. **Use `with` statement** - Always prefer this over manual `open()`/`close()`\n",
    "2. **Handle errors gracefully** - Use try/except for FileNotFoundError and PermissionError\n",
    "3. **Choose the right mode**:\n",
    "   - `'r'` for reading text\n",
    "   - `'w'` for writing text (overwrites existing)\n",
    "   - `'a'` for appending text\n",
    "   - `'rb'`, `'wb'` for binary files\n",
    "4. **Remember file paths** - Use absolute paths when needed\n",
    "5. **Test your code** - Always test with files that exist and don't exist"
