    "## What is a Virtual Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a virtual environment as a **separate workspace** for each Python project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Without virtual environment:** All Python packages are installed globally (like having one big toolbox for all projects)\n",
    "- **With virtual environment:** Each project has its own set of packages (like having separate toolboxes for different projects)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Do We Need It?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple scenario:**\n",
    "- Project A needs package X version 1.0\n",
    "- Project B needs package X version 2.0\n",
    "- Without virtual environments: **Problem!** Can't have both versions installed\n",
    "- With virtual environments: **Solved!** Each project has its own version\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, you can install packages globally. Virtual environments become important when you work on multiple projects."

    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Open your terminal and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv myproject-env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a folder called `myproject-env` with its own Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Activate the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**On Windows:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "myproject-env\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**On Mac/Linux:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source myproject-env/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see `(myproject-env)` appear in your terminal prompt - this means it's active!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Install Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you install packages, they only go into this environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Deactivate When Done\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
